# User Stories Documentation

This directory contains user stories for the **ALX Airbnb Clone Project**, derived from the system's use case diagrams. These user stories represent the core functionalities and interactions for three main user roles within the platform: **Guest**, **Host**, and **Admin**.

## Purpose

User stories help in understanding the system from the end-user perspective. They serve as a foundation for feature development, testing, and project planning by clearly describing what users need and why.

## Structure

The user stories are documented in a single file:

- [`user-stories.md`](./user-stories.md): Contains structured user stories grouped by user roles.

## Roles Covered

- **Guest**: Users who browse, book, pay for, and review properties.
- **Host**: Users who list properties, manage bookings, and receive payouts.
- **Admin**: Users who manage users, properties, payments, and reports.

## Example User Story
